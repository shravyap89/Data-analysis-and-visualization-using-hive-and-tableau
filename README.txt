In this project, we were required to analyse a dataset using Hive and visualize the results using Tableau. 

Enron Dataset: This dataset was collected and prepared by the CALO Project (A Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). 
It contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron, organized into folders. The corpus contains a total of about
0.5M messages. This data was originally made public, and posted to the web, by the federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. 
The dataset resides in Amazon S3: email dataset. The dataset consists of one database table: (primary key are highlighted)


Emails(eid:varchar, timestamp:varchar, from:varchar, to:varchar, cc:varchar, subject:varchar,context:varchar)
